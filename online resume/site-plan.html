      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The job market of today is more competitive than ever, which means job candidates need to do everything they can to set themselves apart 
          from the competition. This is especially true in the tech industry. With lots of candidates, a grueling interview process, and a need for 
          extensive technical knowledge, anything you can do to set yourself apart from the rest is worth doing. One great way that candidates can 
          set themselves apart is by making an online resume in the form of a website. For my final project I will make an online resume to help me 
          market myself to future employers. The website will have information about me, my accomplishments, and qualifications. It will also have 
          photos to help the employers see who I am.

      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>
        Hi!  My name is Ryan Madsen. I am from Kennewick (sometimes called Tri-Cities), Washington where I graduated from Kamiakin High School and Columbia Basin College with an associate arts degree in general studies.  I then went and served as a full-time missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in McAllen, Texas. I returned from my mission in September 2021 and am now working toward becoming a software engineer! I am currently a junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho.  I am studying Software Engineering with an emphasis in software project management. I have lots of different hobbies including skiing, SCUBA diving, ATV riding, and much more.

      <h2>Page 4 - Accomplishments</h2>
      <h4>Eagle Scout - 2017</h4>
      <p>
        To earn my Eagle Scout award I had to complete 21 merit badges (some of which took 3+ months to complete) and complete an Eagle Scout project. The goal of any Eagle Scout project is to do something that benefits others in a positive way while also building leadership skills in the scout doing the project. For my Eagle Scout project, I coordinated and carried out three blood drives for the American Red Cross, collecting 100 units of blood. Throughout the course of the project I had the opportunity to work with representatives from the American Red Cross to plan for use of facilities and advertising for the drives. I was also able to do a lot of networking to recruit people to come and donate blood. I would go to various different church congregations and ask for a few minutes at the beginning of Sunday school to tell people about the drive and pass around a sign up sheet. I would then call the people who signed up the day before the drive to remind them about it. Overall, it was a very successful Eagle Scout Project and I learned a lot about leading and working with others. 
      </p>
      <h4>Seal of Biliteracy - 2019</h4>
      <p>
        Between junior high and high school, I took 4 years of Spanish language classes. In my fourth year of Spanish language class I took the STAMP language proficiency test to certify that I had attained a proficient level of Spanish language skills including reading, writing, listening, and speaking. I passed with flying colors and earned the Spanish Seal of Biliteracy on my high diploma, certifying that I was literate in both the English and Spanish languages.
